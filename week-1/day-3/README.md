### What are we doing?
We are covering the CSS properties and values that you need to know. 

### Why?
There is a standard subset of all of the dozens of properties that exist that you will use ALL THE TIME.
You need to commit these to memory and it will make your life so much easier and CSS less overwhelming being that you
do not need to remember 200 properties to do something significant. 


### How do you know if you are doing well? How do you know if you are on track to be a Front End Developer?
- You can edit the elements with inline style attributes
- you can edit elements with a style block using selectors
- You can edit elements with an external stylesheet
- You can describe the components of the box model
- you know what a selector is.


### Things students forget
TYPOS and syntax for attributes, and style selectors. Practice makes perfect.
