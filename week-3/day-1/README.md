# Vets In Tech Web Development Course

## Week 3 Day 1


### Learning Objectives
- Array Methods
- String Methods
- Pulling data from input
- JS Calculator

## Agenda


### What are we doing?
We are diving deeper into the must know methods of arrays and strings and practing
what we learned by creating a calculator


### Why?
These are some of the most powerful methods because they come up some frequently
when dealing with data from the backend or the user. We need to be able to harness
this power and use it for good! :) 


### How do you know if you are doing well? How do you know if you are on track to be a Front End Developer?
- you're able to add and remove elements from an array by using a function
- you are able to covert a string into an array
- you are able to covert a string into a boolean based on what's in the string
- you are able to take access data from an input field


### Things students forget
not every method on an array can be used on a string
but some methods on a string can be used on array
because you are applying methods to the appropriate data type
