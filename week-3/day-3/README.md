Triggering a modal

### What are we doing?
Covering some more important CSS properties and implementing exercise that shows
up in professional development all the time, rendering a modal.

### Why?
It's good UX to prompt the user are they sure they want to delete "XYZ" before executing
the command. It's a good practice to let the user know that they will be logged out in 
30 secs if they do not use the webpage for security purposes. So on and so forth,
modals are very helpful and frequently used in web development.


### How do you know if you are doing well? How do you know if you are on track to be a Front End Developer?
- you are able to create a modal
- you know when your CSS will be overwritten by another CSS selector.


### Things students forget
- Cascade: "The process of combining different stylesheets and resolving conflicts between different CSS rules and declarations, when more than one rule applies to a certain element" -Jonas Schmedtmann, Web Developer, Designer, and Teacher
- IMPORTANCE > SPECIFICITY > SOURCE ORDER
-CSS declarations marked with !important have the highest priority
-Inline styles have priority over external stylesheets
-A selector that contains 1 ID is more specific than one with 1000 classes
-A selector that contains 1 class is more specific than one with 1000 elements
-The universal selector * has no specificity value (0, 0, 0, 0)
-Rely more on specificity than order of selectors
-Rely on order when using 3rd party stylesheets-  put yours last in the html head or your styles will be over-written by the 3rd party's
