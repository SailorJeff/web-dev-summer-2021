### Why?



### How do you know if you are doing well? How do you know if you are on track to be a Front End Developer?



### Things students forget
- Cascade: "The process of combining different stylesheets and resolving conflicts between different CSS rules and declarations, when more than one rule applies to a certain element" -Jonas Schmedtmann, Web Developer, Designer, and Teacher
- IMPORTANCE > SPECIFICITY > SOURCE ORDER
-CSS declarations marked with !important have the highest priority
-Inline styles have priority over external stylesheets
-A selector that contains 1 ID is more specific than one with 1000 classes
-A selector that contains 1 class is more specific than one with 1000 elements
-The universal selector * has no specificity value (0, 0, 0, 0)
-Rely more on specificity than order of selectors
-Rely on order when using 3rd party stylesheets-  put yours last in the html head or your styles will be over-written by the 3rd party's
